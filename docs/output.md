# Outputs

The pipeline generates the following outputs, located under "results":

* A folder per sample that includes information about quality metrics, raw metaphlan outputs and (optionally) host genome mapping rates
* `Metaphlan3/` A folder for all merged Metaphlan3 outputs - i.e. the count table as well as (optionally) figures
* `MultiQC/` A folder for the combined QC reports
* `pipeline_info` A folder containing the workflow traces
